  # BlankSlate provides an abstract base class with no predefined
  # methods (except for <tt>\_\_send__</tt> and <tt>\_\_id__</tt>).
  # BlankSlate is useful as a base class when writing classes that
  # depend upon <tt>method_missing</tt> (e.g. dynamic proxies).
  class BlankSlate
    instance_methods.each { |m| undef_method m unless m =~ /^(__|instance_eval)/ }
